# <p align="center">Auctions</p>

### What is this?
> This is a commerce website made in Django with Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The website enables auction-style bidding through role-based access control and has many quality-of-life features. Its main focus is to provide a simple and clean user-interface for interacting with auction listings.

### Why?
> This website was originally made as part of a project in Harvard CS50's *Web Programming with Python and JavaScript* course, in which I was tasked with creating a website that has some of the features listed in the section below.
> After completing the requirements, I decided to polish up the user interface add a few more features, since it felt rewarding to take the project further and create a more usable product.

## <p align="center">Key Features</p>
Along with creating and viewing listing pages, there are many key features tailored to creating an easy experience for the user! For your own viewing experience, all of them are listed and shown below as GIFs.
